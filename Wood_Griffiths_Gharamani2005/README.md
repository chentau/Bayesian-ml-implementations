# hidden-causal-learning

This is an implementation of the model proposed in *Woods, Griffiths, Gharamani (2006)*.  Instead of using the scaling limit construction of the Indian Buffet Process as they did in their paper, this project instead uses a stick breaking construction of the IBP specified in *Teh, Gorur, and Gharamani (2007)* and uses a truncated Gibbs Sampler for inference.
